What has changed in each release.

JS8MAP 0.7

* Added a configuration file to remember all settings so you no longer
need to put them on the command line.  A few things on the command line
have changed:

   --lock now just prevents the map from autromatically rescaling.
   --corners now holds the lower-left and upper-right grid coordinates
   	     for the map, as --lock used to do.
   --config specifies an option file if you do not want to use the
   	    default location of js8map.ini.

* There is a new "save config" menu option to save all current settings,
including map zooming and panning, into the configuration file.

JS8MAP 0.6

* Added information popups.  Click on a station to find grid, time
  since last heard from, other stations it hears, station info if known.

* View menu items now display current setting.

JS8MAP 0.56

* Callsign underlining working again.  It indicates a station that
has indicated that it has heard the local station.

* Various bug fixes, especially to history display.

JS8MAP 0.55

* Main window can be resized and everything will scale to fit.

* Maps can now be much better.  The trick is that any suppled
maps in the 'maps' directory must be in EquiRectangular Projection.

* UDP port from JS8CALL can now be set from the command line in
addition to editing the ps8map.py source file.

* New option under the View menu to turn on the display of historical
data on who heard who.  This accumulates all reports of which stations
heard whichother stations during this session.  This does not mean that
they can STILL hear each other, only that they did at one time.

JS8MAP 0.5

* Standard menu functions replace some keystroke commands.

* Callsigns of stations that can hear the local station are underlined.

* Better default map

JS8MAP 0.4

* Addition of a first try world map underlay.  The base image is
  too small so results in a fuzzy result but is good enough to
  make sure that the zooming math is correct.

* Added elapsed time since the last band change to the status line.

* Reduced needless redraws of the map when nothing has changed.

* Background maps can be chosen either with the --map=n commandline
  option or by typing 'm' to the screen and entering a number on
  the console.  This will eventually become a menu choice.

JS8MAP 0.3

* Addition of --icon command option to select initial setting of
  displaying stations as colored icons or as callsigns.

* Relaxation of callsign filtering for what constitutes a
 'proper' callsign.

* Lines representing direct exchanges automatically dissapear
 in one JS8 cycle: 15 seconds.

* Stations sending CQ or HEARTBEAT are indicated by a colored circle.
